# High-Level Functionality of the MVP
The Intellectus MVP is designed to create a raw, unpolished platform where human curiosity merges with artificial intelligence in a shared space. It serves as a public feed where anyone can explore questions posed to an AI and its responses, fostering a community of learning and inspiration. Users can join by creating an account with a unique username, email, and password, gaining the ability to contribute up to 100 questions daily. The feed displays these interactions chronologically, showcasing who asked what, when, and how others engage with it through likes. The experience is intentionally simple and stark, with a black-and-white, monospaced aesthetic, reflecting a pure, unadorned exchange of ideas between humans and machines. The goal is to build a space where browsing teaches users how to interact with AI, turning every post into a lesson in creativity and understanding.

# Breakdown into Sub-Components
Public Feed Exploration:
Allow all visitors, signed-in or not, to view a continuous stream of questions and AI answers. Ensure each post reveals the asker’s username, the exact time it was posted, and a like count to show community interest. The feed should feel like an open archive, growing endlessly with every new contribution.
User Account Creation and Access:
Enable individuals to establish a personal identity within Intellectus by registering with a username, email, and password. This identity should unlock the power to add their own questions, while guests can only observe, creating a clear distinction between passive and active participation.
Question Submission and AI Response:
Provide a dedicated space where registered users can input questions, sending them to an AI (gpt-4.1-nano) that generates thoughtful responses. These question-answer pairs should automatically join the public feed, serving as a shared resource for all to see and learn from.
Daily Contribution Limit:
Set a boundary of 100 questions per day per user to maintain fairness and encourage thoughtful engagement, ensuring the platform doesn’t become overwhelmed by repetitive or low-effort posts.
Engagement Tracking with Likes:
Allow users to express appreciation for posts by adding likes, visible as a count next to each entry. This feature should highlight popular or insightful exchanges, guiding the community toward valuable content.
Unpolished Visual Identity:
Craft a design that prioritizes function over form, using a black background, white monospaced text, and minimal styling. This aesthetic should evoke a terminal-like feel, emphasizing the raw connection between human input and machine output.


# Intellectus Development Blueprint
## Mission Statement
Intellectus is our bold venture to forge a space where human intellect intertwines with artificial wisdom. We aim to construct a living feed of questions and AI responses, accessible to all, where registered users shape the conversation with up to 100 daily contributions. Our vision is a stark, black-and-white realm that teaches through exploration, celebrating the fusion of mind and machine.
## Core Objectives
### Public Feed Exploration

Deliver an open, unending stream where every visitor can witness questions posed to the AI and its answers.
Display each post with the asker’s username, posting timestamp, and like count, creating a transparent record of activity.
Ensure the feed grows naturally, preserving every interaction as a permanent testament to collective curiosity.

### User Account Creation and Access

Offer a registration process where users define a unique username, email, and password to join the community.
Grant registered users the privilege to contribute questions, while restricting unregistered visitors to viewing only.
Maintain a clear boundary between observers and creators to foster active participation.

### Question Submission and AI Response

Provide a dedicated input area for registered users to submit questions to the AI (gpt-4.1-nano).
Generate and share AI responses instantly, adding them to the public feed as a shared knowledge resource.
Ensure each question-answer pair becomes a building block for community learning and inspiration.

### Daily Contribution Limit

Implement a cap of 100 questions per user per day to promote thoughtful engagement.
Prevent the feed from being flooded, preserving its value as a space for meaningful exchange.
Encourage users to refine their questions, enhancing the quality of interactions.

### Engagement Tracking with Likes

Enable users to add likes to posts, displaying a count to reflect community appreciation.
Highlight popular or insightful exchanges, guiding users toward the most valuable content.
Foster a sense of connection through visible recognition of great ideas.

### Unpolished Visual Identity

Design a stark interface with a black background and white monospaced text, avoiding decorative elements.
Create a terminal-like aesthetic that emphasizes the raw exchange between human and AI.
Prioritize functionality, ensuring the design supports the platform’s educational and communal goals.

## Development Roadmap
### Initial Foundation

Establish the project structure within the cloned NoahRocket/X repository.
Connect to Netlify for a public presence and Supabase for data management.
Secure an OpenAI API key to power AI interactions.

### Data Structure and Access

Define a user system to store usernames, emails, and creation timestamps.
Create a post system to hold questions, AI responses, like counts, and posting times.
Set up security rules to allow public reading and authenticated posting.

### User Interaction Layer

Build a registration and login interface for users to join and access posting.
Integrate a logout option and restrict posting to signed-in users.
Ensure the interface reflects the unpolished, monospaced design.

### Feed and Contribution System

Develop a feed display showing all posts in reverse chronological order.
Create a question input area that triggers AI responses and feed updates.
Enforce the 100-question daily limit for each user.

### Validation and Launch

Test the feed, posting, and account features to ensure seamless operation.
Deploy the platform live on Netlify for public access.
Monitor user interactions to validate the learning-through-browsing experience.

### Optional Enhancements

Add basic feedback for empty inputs or AI failures.
Refine the visual layout for consistency.
Include a loading indicator during AI response generation.

### Future Vision

Expand with sorting and filtering by topic or popularity.
Introduce premium features like advanced AI models or private feeds.
Share the platform with early testers to gather insights and grow the community.
